# Introduction #

This is a final project for Cornell Univserity's ECE 4760 [Design with Microcontrollers](http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/ee476/) class. We are creating an acoustic data modem where data accepted over RS-232 is encoded acoustically using multiple parallel frequencies and an encoding derived from FSK. Upon reception it is decoded and transmitted in order as RS-232 data to a computer endpoint.

Current status is listed on ProgressReports.
