<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>		
For our final design project, we designed and built a prototype acoustic modem to serve as a physical transport layer for digital communications. 
It converts between a digital communications scheme (RS-232) and an acoustically coupled communications scheme of our own design. Our project 
consists of a pair of such modems to operate as transmit/receive pairs and supports duplex communications. Although our modem operates in air, 
it is a proof-of-concept experiment in encoding, decoding, and data transmission techniques that will be used in the following years by the CUAUV 
team to design a system capable of communicating over some distance underwater.
</p>

<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>
We chose this product because of its relevance to a student project team we were both members of, 
CUAUV (Cornell University Autonomous Underwater Vehicle team). Usually, remote-controlled vehicles use 
radio frequency (RF) wireless communications to transmit data between the device and its operator. 
However, due to the nature of water, electromagnetic waves do not propagate well, with an effective 
range of about a foot, depending on frequency. This makes them unsuitable for communicating with AUVs. 
Acoustic data, however, can propagate very far underwater and acoustic underwater communications is 
currently an important area of research at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute (WHOI). Inspired by their 
success and the existence of several commercial acoustic modems, our team has as a long term goal the 
creation of an acoustic modem that can be used to communicate with the vehicle while it is in the water 
without a tether. Our project serves as a prototype to help us develop our own algorithms and techniques 
for encoding and processing data acoustically.
</p>

<h3 id="math">Background Math</h3>
<p>
Because we used cheap audio-range speakers and microphones, our project was limiting to transmitting within 
the range of human hearing, ~20 Hz - 20 kHz. Therefore, we selected an encoding scheme that minimized per-byte 
bandwidth utilization while retaining simplicity, so that it was possible to implement decoding. The two most 
intuitive and basic digital encoding schemes are frequency-shift keying, where data is transmitted on a pair of 
frequencies, each representing a distinct digital value, and on-off keying, where the presence or absence of a 
single frequency is used to encode a digital value. We chose the second (OOK) because it requires half the acoustic 
bandwidth (uses only one frequency per channel, rather than two) to transmit a particular amount of data. We 
also chose to use an asynchronous design in order to avoid paying for the overhead of having an additional 
clock frequency, instead breaking the transmissions into a series of known-width pulses. Transmitted data is 
broken into chunks of 64 samples so as to conveniently fit into a power of two size buffer so that it can efficiently 
be implemented as a circular buffer. Each physical frame consists of a start bit (S1, a one bit), eight data bits, 
most-significant-bit first, and a stop bit (S2, a zero bit). At a sampling rate of 40 kHz (chosen to avoid aliasing 
across the entire 20 Hz-20 kHz range), 64 samples corresponds to a pulse width of 1.6 ms, which limits each frequency 
channel to transmitting 62.5 complete frames per second as a theoretical max.

	<img src="frame.png" alt="" width="510"/>
	<p class="caption">Sample Transmission Frame</p>
</div></center>
</p><p>
Next, as we are limited by the computational power of our Atemga644 microcontroller, and we would ideally transmit and 
receive from a single microcontroller, we designed a hybrid algorithm for detecting transmitted data using FIR filters 
to estimate the magnitude of specific frequency components over time. For each frequency of interest (which will be 
derived afterwards), we resample at that frequency, exploiting aliasing to obtain a DC component corresponding to the 
amplitude of the frequency. Because the cosine of zero is one, the magnitude of the DC component can be estimated with 
a simple sum of those samples. However, because the real frequency component may have a non-zero phase shift associated 
with it, at DC it will have an analogous "phase shift" which requires that a second resampler to be used with a 90-degree 
phase delay-this pair together can estimate the Fourier Transform evaluated at DC for phase and magnitude information.
<center><div class="main-photo-large">
	<img src="flowchart.png" alt="" width="510"/>
	<p class="caption">Magnitude Estimation Process Flowchart</p>
</div></center>
</p><p>
However, it is important to consider the effects of aliasing on frequencies OTHER than the frequency of interest. Usually, 
aliasing is a bad property to have in a digital system, as it can cause other frequencies to appear as the target frequency. 
For instance, when sampling at 6 kHz, the possible aliases that are within our analog pass-band and appear as a DC signal are 
true DC, 6 kHz, 12 kHz, and 18 kHz. Therefore, in selecting the frequencies for our transmission channels, if we choose 6 
kHz as a transmit frequency, we cannot also use 12 or 18 kHz. Because the Fourier Transform estimator is implemented as a 
moving average, it can also be interpreted as an FIR filter, which has a known frequency response. An N-term moving average 
filter has a frequency response characterized by a maximum at DC and ?N/2? zeros evenly spaced around the unit circle. The 
number of terms in the moving average filter for each frequency is chosen by having the length of the filter match the length 
of each burst in time (1.6 ms). Because it is unlikely for these to match precisely, the filters are usually defined to extend 
one sample longer than the burst. In general, therefore, with sampling frequency fs and target frequency f, the length of the 
appropriate averaging filter is <img src="" alt="N=|64/(fs/f)|" />. For example, for 6 kHz, N is 10. Because the window is so short, it is important 
to minimize the interference between frequency channels, which is most easily done by having each channel fall match with a zero 
in the moving average for all of the other channels. Due to aliasing between the channels, a particular channel frequency may also 
fall on the alias of a zero rather than the normal interpretation of the zero.

	<h3 id="soft_ex">Software Execution</h3>
		<p>Due
to careful consideration and planning of the non-blocking functions in our
software, the user interactions with the Electric Etch performed over a serial
terminal on a PC were all very concurrent and lag-free. Save for the response
to the ‘help’ command, which transmitted a large chunk of text over serial, the
microcontroller’s software operated without any hiccups or latency. Commands
were still interpreted and acted upon, even while the stepper motors were in
full motion. Longer software testing would have surely revealed bugs, but the
basic functionality we aimed for worked consistently.
		</p>

		<h3 id="accuracy">Accuracy</h3>
		<p>The
biggest accuracy compromises came from the mechanical Etch-a-Sketch device
itself. Over time, its backlash characteristics wandered, its knobs would
randomly stiffen up, and some points on the screen would exhibit very
inconsistent mechanical characteristics. For these reasons, the accuracy of
drawing precise characters on the screen was a hit-and-miss affair. Backlash is
common to many mechanical devices, but in the case of the Etch-a-Sketch, where
no form of feedback was implemented, it proved to be quite a frustration.
Otherwise, software kept an accurate time base and the circuitry also proved
very reliable.
		</p>
		<h3 id="safety">Safety Enforcement</h3>
		<p>
		Since the device is highly mechanical as well as electrical, safety of both aspectes should be ensured. In order to enforce the mechanical safety, all the parts were carefully machined to be bolted together rather than tying or taping them. Also, since the motors require heavy duty powering, electronic chips as well as the motors tend to get rather hot. In order to avoid possible overheating of the components, all the chips were operated below their threshold and a heat sink was implemented to  H-bridge of the bipolar tilt motor.
		</p>
		<h3 id="interference">Interference and Accessibility</h3>

		<p>
		Most
of the work on this project was performed outside of the ECE 476 lab in the
labs of our respective project teams, where we had access to better equipment
and more space. We therefore did not notice any interference with other
people's designs, and since we didn't use any RF circuitry, no interference was
expected. In terms of accessibility, our design requires users to be able to
use some method of computer text entry, like a keyboard or voice recognition,
to communicate to the device through a serial port terminal program running on
a PC. Also, as this is a visual device, it is not at all useful for the
visually-impaired. These are the only accessibility limitations which we
thought of. When designing the terminal interface, we took care to give
user-friendly textual descriptions of the functions, and look for and give
feedback about input errors without using cryptic codes. For instance, instead
of replying "RX Buffer Overflow" when a user types in too long of a command,
the software actually says, "Sorry, your command was too long. Try again!" and
suggests a comprehensive commands list for other problems. After all, we did
design this project for the kids inside all of us!

		<h3 id="analysis">Analysis of Results</h3>
		<p>On
the whole, we were able to successfully achieve the functions we set out to
implement by motorizing the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. We implemented a working
erasing mechanism, and had an imperfect but satisfactory character set which we
could draw on the screen. Like we intended, we were able to draw static
messages and display minute time on the Electric Etch. In hindsight, we agree
that we should have spent more time on the software with clear, well-rested
minds. The lack of sleep amplified our frustrations with the Etch-a-Sketch’s mechanical
problems, and slowed down the debugging process. In the end, we fear that we
might have had some yet-to-be-discovered software bugs that would have reared
their heads if we had more time to test.</p>
<p>But,
setting time management issues aside, if we were to repeat the ECE 4760 experience
with a similar project, we would have certainly implemented some kind of
feedback mechanism that would help us better compensate for the Etch-a-Sketch’s
mechanical shortcomings. This could be done by using servomotors instead of
stepper motors. We were, however, very proud of our stand and assembly, which
was fashioned completely out of scrap parts and yet looked very polished
&#8211; even matching the Etch-a-Sketch’s color scheme!</p>
		<h3 id="st_conformity">Standards Conformity</h3>
		<p>
		As
stated before, the only notable standard involved in our design was the RS-232
serial protocol used by the microcontroller to communicate with the PC. This common
standard was implemented in the hardware of the MEGA644 microcontroller and in
the MAX233 level transceiver, removing any efforts to conform to it from us,
the designers.
		</p>

		<h3 id="IP">IP Considerations</h3>
		<p>
		Our
software borrowed the line-drawing code from the <a
href="http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/ee476/labs/s2009/lab4code/video_codeGCC644.c">sample
code</a> provided by Bruce Land for <a
href="http://instruct1.cit.cornell.edu/courses/ee476/labs/s2009/lab4.html">Lab
4</a> of this class, which he credits to David Rodgers, the author of &quot;Procedural
Elements of Computer Graphics&quot;.  While we did not get a hold of this book
for verification, we referred to the University of North Carolina's <a
href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/~mcmillan/comp136/Lecture6/Lines.html">web page</a>

on line-drawing algorithms to understand how this particular implementation
worked.
		</p><p>
		We
also acknowledge <a href="http://angelayuan.com/projects.html">Angela Yuan's
Etch-a-Sketch clock project</a> as the source of our inspiration, and the trail
of Etch-a-Sketch projects which she references in her documentation.
Fortunately, none of these projects had accurate, in-depth information of how
they were implemented &#8211; not even so much as the chips used for the
projects. This left much of the implementation for us to build up from scratch,
and so we feel we have not compromised the integrity of our work. Our work,
presented on this website, is in the public domain and is in no way proprietary
information &#8211; that is to say, it is for academic purposes only and is not
intended by us, the designers, for anything outside the purposes of this class,
including, but not limited to, personal profit, ending world hunger, or
weaponry. We feel that we fully align with Cornell's <a
href="http://www.cuinfo.cornell.edu/Academic/AIC.html">Code of Academic
Integrity</a>.
		</p><p>
		Furthermore,
we did not attempt to reverse-engineer any pre-existing designs, and we neither
claim invention nor exclusive rights to any of our work. We are not advertising
this project for monetary gain. We feel that by acknowledging this, we are
avoiding any patent and trademark issues. As this is not necessarily a novel
idea in the sense that it has not been done before, it does not readily present
itself as a patent opportunity, and we do not aim to pursue any patents.
		</p><p>

		We
are open to publishing opportunities should interested parties make themselves
known.
		</p>
		<h3 id="ethical">Ethical Considerations</h3>
		<p>
		Our device operates in a small
confined region without any wide range of motion, projectiles, or signal
transmission. As long as the user makes sure to follow the electrical voltage
and current requirements and to keep a safe distance from the gear set, our
device would not impose any physical or environmental threat to its users and
surroundings. As an advanced version of a classic toy, our device would not
cause conflicts of interest of any form. Based on our results, we do not claim
to have the perfect motorized control of Etch-a-Sketch. There are some less
obvious mechanical complications are involved, and we recognize that our design
has limitations to address the complications. Because our design does not provide
any advantage to any group of people or individuals over others, there is no
bribery involved with out project. Since our project was to design an advanced
toy, it does not have great effect on the contemporary cutting-edge technology.
What is moderately pertinent to our project may be any device that requires the
precise motor position control, such as plotter, machining equipments, or
printing equipments. We were exercising our technical skills such as soldering
and machining only if we were allowed, when we were allowed, and where we were
allowed. We acknowledge our mechanical engineer classmates who have given very
useful advices for the structure of our device and appreciate their helpful
input to our design. Also, we acknowledge our respective labs where we had a
great advantage of using the facilities as well as mechanical and electrical
components. Our device does not have any limitation for any group of people or
individuals except possibly for visually challenged individuals since it is a
displaying device. Our device is a passive device, which does not contain or
transmit any personal data or impose threat to anyone's property of reputation.
While we were designing our device, we were cooperative with our classmates,
especially the ones who were also using stepper motors, in order to share
information and encourage each others design projects.
		</p>
		<h3 id="legal">Legal Considerations</h3>
		<p>
		As mentioned above in ethical
considerations section, our device is a passive, confined, and safe device
which does not transmit any signal. Therefore, there are no crucial legal
considerations involved in our project.
